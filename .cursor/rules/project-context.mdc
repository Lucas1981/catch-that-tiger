# Catch That Tiger - Project Context

When working on this codebase, consult these files for project context:

- **PLAN.md** - Full specification: architecture, module specs, implementation order, time management (60fps frame-based updates)
- **TODO.md** - Progress tracker; update when completing tasks

Build incrementally, one file or function at a time. Follow the implementation order in PLAN.md.
